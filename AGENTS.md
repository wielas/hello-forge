# hello-forge — agent context (single source of truth)

Day-one end-to-end test of the Forge lane.

Hand-curated. Keep under ~120 lines; every line costs every session context.
(Research consensus: human-curated context helps; auto-generated bloat hurts.)

## Commands
- `make setup` — install deps + hooks · `make check` — THE green proof
- `make fmt` / `make lint` / `make test`

## Workflow (Forge)
This project runs the Forge methodology. Ceremony skills: /scope, /architect,
/roadmap, /start-chunk, /end-chunk, /judge. Foundation docs:
`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`,
chunk contracts in `docs/chunks/`, running notes in `docs/decision-log.md`.

## Hard constraints (gates enforce these; listed here for orientation)
- No direct pushes to main; one chunk = one branch `chunk/<id>-<slug>` = one PR.
- `make check` green before any PR; never bypass hooks (`--no-verify` is a
  fireable offense for agents).
- New runtime dependency ⇒ new/updated ADR in the same branch.
- Scenarios (`tests/features/`) are the living spec — never weaken a Then-clause
  to make it pass; escalate instead.

## Conventions
- Python 3.12, uv-managed. src layout: `src/hello_forge/`.
- Commits: `type(<chunk-id>): imperative message`, granular.
- Errors: raise specific exceptions; no bare except; log at boundaries only.

## Gotchas
(append via /end-chunk doc reconciliation — newest first)
